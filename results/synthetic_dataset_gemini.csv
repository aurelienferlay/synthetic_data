Patient: Mx. ___
Unit No: ___
Admission Date: ___
Discharge Date: ___
Date of Birth: ___
Sex: Undisclosed
Service: Internal Medicine

Allergies: Penicillin

Attending Physician: Dr. ___

Chief Complaint: Weakness, nausea, and rash

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None performed during this admission. Wound irrigation and debridement performed at bedside.

History of Present Illness:
Mx. ___ presented to the emergency department with complaints of generalized weakness, nausea, and a spreading rash that began shortly after working with paints and dyes in a poorly ventilated area. The patient reported skin exposure to the materials. In addition, the patient reported worsening discomfort from a previous reptile bite wound on the left lower leg, which had become more painful and appeared inflamed. This wound was the site of a laceration treated previously for which the patient was in a subsequent phase of recovery. The patient also reported chronic, significant pain in the right knee due to known osteoarthritis, which had been particularly bothersome in recent weeks but was not the primary reason for seeking urgent care.

Past Medical History:
- Right knee osteoarthritis (managed with pain relievers)
- Prior treatment for lower leg laceration following unspecified incident
- Reptile bite to left lower leg
- Seasonal allergies

Social History:
Lives independently. Does not smoke or consume alcohol. Employed in a field that involves exposure to various materials.

Family History: Non-contributory for this admission.

Physical Exam upon Admission:
General: Appears fatigued, mildly distressed.
Vital Signs: Within normal limits except for slight tachycardia.
Skin: Erythematous, non-pruritic rash noted on torso and upper extremities. Left lower leg with an erythematous, slightly swollen wound site with minimal serous drainage, tender to palpation.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Gastrointestinal: Mildly nauseated, non-tender abdomen.
Neurological: Alert and oriented x3, no focal deficits.
Musculoskeletal: Right knee with decreased range of motion and tenderness upon palpation consistent with chronic osteoarthritis.

Pertinent Results:
Initial laboratory tests revealed mild elevation in liver enzymes. Complete blood count was within normal limits. Basic metabolic panel showed no significant electrolyte abnormalities. Wound culture from the lower leg was negative for bacterial growth. Imaging of the right knee was not performed during this admission, relying on prior documentation consistent with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for evaluation and management of suspected toxic effect from paints and dyes and complications related to the reptile bite and associated laceration wound.
Treatment focused on supportive care for the possible toxic exposure, including IV fluids and antiemetics for nausea. The rash resolved spontaneously over 48 hours with minimal intervention. Liver enzymes trended downwards during the stay, approaching baseline by discharge.
The left lower leg wound was cleaned and debrided at the bedside. The area showed signs of inflammation but no gross infection; topical antiseptic and sterile dressing changes were initiated. The patient received a short course of empiric antibiotics covering potential wound pathogens, though wound cultures were ultimately negative.
Pain management for both the lower leg wound and the chronic right knee osteoarthritis was addressed using a combination of acetaminophen and prescribed opioid analgesics. Physical therapy evaluated the patient for mobility and provided recommendations for managing chronic knee pain, emphasizing exercises and strategies to maintain function.
The patient's symptoms improved significantly during the hospital stay. Nausea resolved, skin findings cleared, and the lower leg wound showed signs of healing with reduced inflammation. The patient was ambulating independently with minimal pain from the lower leg and manageable pain from the right knee osteoarthritis.

Medications on Admission:
1. Acetaminophen PRN Pain
2. Multivitamin daily

Discharge Medications:

**Physical Exam:**
Upon admission, patient was febrile and appeared fatigued but in no acute distress.
Vital Signs: Elevated temperature (up to ___), otherwise within normal limits.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, 2/6 systolic murmur noted at the left sternal border. No peripheral edema.
Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, bowel sounds normoactive.
Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3, no focal deficits.
Skin: Warm, no significant rashes noted on admission. PICC line site clean and dry on discharge.
Musculoskeletal: Full range of motion in extremities except limited by pain in right knee (chronic osteoarthritis). Non-tender over large joints except right knee. Left neck area soft, no palpable cords or overt swelling.

**Pertinent Results:**
*   Initial blood cultures (collected on admission): Positive for *Neisseria meningitidis*. Subsequent blood cultures drawn after initiation of IV antibiotics were negative.
*   Echocardiogram (___): Demonstrated vegetation on the aortic valve. Mild aortic regurgitation noted.
*   Neck Venous Duplex Ultrasound (___): Confirmed chronic thrombosis and partial recanalization of the left internal jugular vein. No acute thrombus extension seen.
*   CBC: Elevated WBC on admission, trending down with treatment. Anemia (likely chronic from illness). Platelets stable.
*   CMP: Within normal limits, blood glucose controlled.
*   Inflammatory Markers (ESR, CRP): Significantly elevated on admission, showing improvement during hospitalization.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
Mr. ___ was admitted to the medical service with presumptive diagnosis of sepsis. Initial workup included blood cultures which subsequently grew *Neisseria meningitidis*. Given the clinical picture (fevers, new murmur) and positive blood cultures, an echocardiogram was performed, revealing aortic valve vegetation consistent with infective endocarditis. Infectious Disease service was consulted and the patient was started on appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy (e.g., Ceftriaxone) after sensitivities returned.

Throughout the hospitalization, the patient's fevers resolved and his clinical status improved significantly with antibiotic treatment. A PICC line was placed to facilitate long-term intravenous antibiotic administration. His chronic left internal jugular vein thrombosis was managed by continuing his pre-existing anticoagulation regimen, which was monitored closely. There were no signs of acute thrombosis or extension. The known right knee osteoarthritis remained stable and did not require intervention during this admission, as the focus was entirely on managing the endocarditis and associated complications. Physical therapy evaluated the patient due to deconditioning from his prolonged illness and provided recommendations for light activity and mobility assistance as needed. The patient tolerated his medical therapy well, without significant adverse effects from antibiotics or anticoagulation. By the time of discharge, he was afebrile, vital signs were stable, and he felt significantly stronger. Blood cultures were negative, indicating clearance of bacteremia.

**Patient Identifier:** MRN: ###

**Admission Date:** MM/DD/YYYY
**Discharge Date:** MM/DD/YYYY
**Date of Birth:** MM/DD/YYYY
**Sex:** Male
**Service:** Orthopedic Surgery

**Allergies:** Penicillin (Rash)

**Attending Physician:** Dr. ___

**Chief Complaint:**
Severe, chronic left knee pain with significant functional limitation.

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**History of Present Illness:**
Mr. ___ is a pleasant gentleman with a long history of worsening left knee pain attributed to severe osteoarthritis. His symptoms have progressed over the past several years, significantly impacting his mobility, activities of daily living, and quality of life. Conservative management, including physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and multiple intra-articular corticosteroid injections, provided only temporary relief and ultimately failed to adequately control his pain or improve function. Given the advanced state of joint degeneration visualized on imaging and his persistent symptoms, the decision was made to proceed with left total knee arthroplasty. The patient also has a complex medical history including idiopathic aseptic necrosis of the right tibia, which impacts his baseline mobility and required careful pre-operative assessment and planning regarding rehabilitation expectations. His history of anal canal neoplasm is reportedly stable following prior treatment, and a known metabolic disorder (Disorder of sulfur-bearing amino-acid metabolism) is managed medically under the care of his specialists. These chronic conditions were considered in the planning and management of his orthopedic surgery.

**Past Medical History:**
- Severe Osteoarthritis, left knee
- Idiopathic Aseptic Necrosis, right tibia
- Malignant Neoplasm, anal canal (status post treatment)
- Disorder of Sulfur-Bearing Amino-Acid Metabolism, unspecified
- Essential Hypertension
- Hyperlipidemia

**Social History:**

**Pertinent Results:**
Date/Time: [Discharge Date/Time] CBC - WBC: 6.2 K/uL, Hgb: 12.5 g/dL, Hct: 37.8%, Plt: 215 K/uL. Basic Metabolic Panel unremarkable. Coagulation studies within normal limits pre-operatively.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted electively for left total knee arthroplasty. Pre-operative clearance was obtained from cardiology and metabolic specialist services given his complex medical history. The surgical procedure was performed as planned and was well-tolerated without immediate complications. Post-operatively, the patient was managed with a multimodal pain regimen involving intravenous and oral medications to ensure comfort while facilitating early mobilization. Physical therapy was initiated on post-operative day 1, focusing on range of motion, strengthening, and gait training. Progress was steady, though influenced by his pre-existing right tibia issue, requiring careful planning of weight distribution and balance. He was advanced to weight-bearing as tolerated on the operative left leg, utilizing an assistive device for stability. DVT prophylaxis was initiated with oral medication. Wound care involved initial bulky dressing changed to a lighter, secure dressing. Labs were monitored daily, showing expected post-operative changes. The patient successfully transitioned to oral pain control and was tolerating a regular diet without nausea or constipation (with prophylactic stool softeners). Coordination with home health services was established to ensure continued physical therapy and support at home. At the time of discharge, his pain was well-managed, incision was healing well, and he was functionally prepared to return home with support. His chronic conditions remained stable during the hospitalization and were managed according to his baseline regimens.

**Chief Complaint:**
Severe right knee pain and recent left wrist injury.

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
Left wrist immobilization with custom splint.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient is a Mr. ___ who presented to the hospital due to an acute exacerbation of chronic right knee pain, which had become significantly worse over the past week. This increased pain was compounded by a fall that occurred approximately three days prior to admission, resulting in a painful left wrist. Imaging revealed a non-displaced fracture of the hook of the hamate bone in the left wrist. The patient reported difficulty mobilizing safely due to the combined pain in the right knee and the instability/pain in the left wrist, leading to impaired function and inability to manage pain effectively at home. Admission was pursued for comprehensive pain management and initiation of appropriate care for both conditions.

**Past Medical History:**
Chronic unilateral primary osteoarthritis of the right knee, Hypertension, Hyperlipidemia.

**Social History:**
Lives alone, independent with activities of daily living prior to current issues. Non-smoker. Occasional social alcohol use.

**Family History:**
History of heart disease in father.

**Physical Exam:**
General: Appears comfortable at rest in bed. No acute distress.
Vital Signs: Stable, afebrile.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.
Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Gastrointestinal: Abdomen soft, non-tender. Bowel sounds normal.
Genitourinary: Voiding without difficulty.
Neurologic: Alert and oriented x 3, cranial nerves intact, no gross motor or sensory deficits.
Musculoskeletal:
Right Knee: Moderate swelling and tenderness to palpation along joint line. Range of motion limited by pain (estimated 10-90 degrees flexion). Ambulation significantly limited, requiring maximum assistance with walker.
Left Wrist: Visible swelling over the ulnar side of the palm. Point tenderness over the hook of the hamate region. Active and passive range of motion of wrist and digits limited by pain, particularly with grip. Distal pulses intact, capillary refill brisk. Neurologically intact distally. Patient was fitted with a protective splint.

**Pertinent Results:**

Basic Metabolic Panel: Electrolytes, renal function, and glucose within acceptable range.
Right Knee X-ray: Moderate to severe degenerative changes consistent with osteoarthritis.
Left Wrist X-ray: Confirmed non-displaced fracture of the hook process of the hamate bone.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted to the Orthopedic service for management of severe right knee osteoarthritis pain complicated by a recent non-displaced left hamate fracture impacting mobility and pain control.

Upon admission, pain management was optimized with a combination of scheduled oral analgesics and as-needed breakthrough medication. Physical therapy was consulted to assess mobility and develop a safe ambulation plan given the limitations imposed by both the knee pain and the wrist fracture. Therapy focused on gait training using an appropriate assistive device and instructions on transferring safely while protecting the injured wrist. Occupational therapy evaluated the patient's ability to perform daily tasks and provided recommendations for adaptive techniques and equipment, and reinforced the importance of the wrist splint.

Orthopedics evaluated the left wrist fracture. Given the non-displaced nature, conservative management with immobilization was chosen. A custom thermoplastic splint was fabricated and fitted for the patient, providing support to the wrist and limiting movement that could exacerbate pain or risk displacement of the fracture. Hand specialist follow-up was arranged for ongoing management and potential hand therapy referral.

The patient tolerated the hospital stay well. Pain in both the knee and wrist improved with the implemented regimen, allowing for slow but steady progress in functional mobility with assistance. There were no significant complications during the hospitalization. Prior home medications were reviewed and continued. At the time of discharge, the patient reported satisfactory pain control on oral medication and was able to ambulate short distances safely with a walker, requiring verbal cues and standby assistance.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
Mr. \_\_\_ was admitted to the Orthopedic Surgery service for staged surgical treatment of symptomatic right knee osteoarthritis and left radial collateral ligament rupture. The left elbow ligament repair was performed initially, followed by the right total knee arthroplasty a few days later. Both procedures were technically successful and without immediate complication.

Postoperatively, the patient required aggressive pain management due to recovery from two separate surgical sites. Pain was controlled with a multimodal approach including IV and oral opioids, acetaminophen, and gabapentin. He transitioned successfully to oral pain medications prior to discharge.

Physical therapy was initiated early, focusing on range of motion and strengthening exercises for both the right lower extremity (following TKA protocols) and the left upper extremity (with strict limitations due to the ligament repair). Weight-bearing as tolerated was permitted on the right lower extremity, while the left elbow remained immobilized. Occupational therapy provided assistance with activities of daily living given the restrictions on the left arm.

DVT prophylaxis was initiated postoperatively with aspirin 325 mg twice daily. Surveillance labs were monitored, showing expected post-operative changes. Incision sites were inspected daily and remained clean and dry.

The patient tolerated a regular diet throughout his stay. Prior to discharge, he demonstrated independence with transfers and mobility using appropriate assistive devices for the right knee, while maintaining the necessary restrictions on the left elbow.

- Right Lower Extremity: Stable, well-healed stump. Reports baseline stump and occasional phantom pain.
- Right Knee: Mild swelling, decreased range of motion, crepitus with movement.
Skin: Incision (if any related to prior forearm management attempt) clean and dry, or skin intact over fracture site. No signs of acute infection or breakdown noted over stump.

**Pertinent Results:**
[General description of lab trends rather than specific values]
Hemoglobin and Hematocrit stable throughout stay, reflecting no acute blood loss. Renal function remained stable. Electrolytes within normal limits. Inflammatory markers (CRP/ESR) were monitored and showed no significant acute infectious process. Pain scores trended down with adjusted regimen. Radiographs of the right forearm obtained during admission confirmed persistent nonunion with no significant interval change from prior imaging.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted to the Hospitalist service for management of severe, acute-on-chronic pain related to a known pathological nonunion of the right forearm fracture, complicated by multiple chronic pain generators and a history of adverse medication effects.
Upon admission, the patient's pain was assessed using a numerical rating scale and found to be severe despite his home regimen. Pain management was initiated and carefully titrated, utilizing multimodal analgesia including scheduled non-opioid agents and cautious use of short-acting opioids, taking into account his complex pain history and prior adverse medication experiences. Consultations were obtained from Orthopedics to re-evaluate the nonunion and from Pain Management to assist with optimizing the chronic pain plan. Orthopedics reviewed imaging and clinical status, confirming nonunion and discussing future options which may include surgical intervention, pending further outpatient evaluation and patient decision-making. The Pain Management team provided recommendations for a discharge regimen aimed at balancing pain control with minimizing side effects.
During the stay, the patient's other chronic conditions were monitored. His osteoarthritis pain was managed with existing and adjusted analgesic strategies. Stump/phantom pain remained at his baseline level. Mobility was limited primarily by the forearm pain and right lower extremity amputation. Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy were consulted to assess functional limitations related to the forearm and develop strategies for activities of daily living and safe mobility given his amputation. They provided training on adaptive techniques and weight-bearing precautions for the upper extremity.
The patient tolerated the adjusted medication regimen well, with gradual improvement in reported pain levels, allowing for progression toward discharge. He was able to participate in therapy sessions as tolerated. Discharge planning focused on ensuring adequate pain control at home, arranging necessary follow-up, and coordinating home support services.

"**Hospital Discharge Summary**

**Patient Name:** Mr. ___
**Medical Record Number:** ___
**Admission Date:** ___
**Discharge Date:** ___
**Date of Birth:** ___
**Sex:** Male
**Service:** Orthopedic Surgery

**Allergies:**
No Known Allergies (NKA)

**Attending Physician:** Dr. ___

**Chief Complaint:**
Severe, debilitating left knee pain with functional limitation.

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:**
Left Total Knee Arthroplasty

**History of Present Illness:**
Mr. ___ is an elderly male admitted electively for scheduled left total knee arthroplasty due to advanced, painful, tricompartmental osteoarthritis refractory to conservative management. During the pre-operative workup, or early in the hospital stay, evaluation for chronic cough revealed findings consistent with primary pulmonary tuberculosis, confirmed by microscopy of sputum revealing acid-fast bacilli. This concurrent diagnosis necessitated adjustments to the perioperative plan and added a significant medical complexity to the hospitalization. He also has a remote history of an unspecified vascular injury to his right upper arm with residual sequelae, which impacts his ability to use that limb for assistance, particularly during ambulation and transfers.

**Past Medical History:**
1. Unilateral primary osteoarthritis, left knee (M1710)
2. Primary tuberculous infection, unspecified, tubercle bacilli found (in sputum) (01093)
3. Sequela of unspecified injury of unspecified blood vessel at shoulder and upper arm level, right arm (S45901S)
4. Hypertension
5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (Diet controlled)

**Social History:**
Lives alone. Former smoker, quit 10 years ago. Denies current alcohol or illicit drug use.

**Family History:**
Noncontributory.

**Physical Exam:**
General: Well-appearing male, comfortable at rest, sitting up in bed.
Vitals: Stable and within normal limits. Afebrile.
Respiratory: Coarse breath sounds bilaterally, mild scattered rhonchi. Cough occasionally productive of small amounts of clear sputum.
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, no murmurs. Capillary refill brisk.
Gastrointestinal: Abdomen soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present.
Genitourinary: Voiding without difficulty.
Neurologic: Alert and oriented x3. Grossly intact sensation and strength in bilateral upper and lower extremities, except for right upper extremity weakness/limitation related to sequela.
Musculoskeletal: Left lower extremity: Surgical incision clean, dry, intact, without significant erythema or drainage. Mild swelling of the operative knee and thigh. Range of motion improving with therapy. Tenderness to palpation around incision. Right upper extremity: Limited active range of motion at shoulder and elbow, with decreased grip strength, consistent with documented sequela. Right lower extremity: Unremarkable.
Skin: Warm and dry. No rash.

**Pertinent Results:**
Laboratory results showed mild post-operative anemia requiring monitoring. White blood cell count trended within normal limits. Initial sputum microscopy positive for acid-fast bacilli. Chest X-ray demonstrated infiltrates consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. Repeat sputum microscopy prior to discharge showed reduction in bacterial load, but therapy initiated. Basic metabolic panel and liver function tests monitored, particularly with initiation of TB medications.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted for elective left total knee arthroplasty. Pre-operatively, or upon admission screening, his chronic cough prompted investigation leading to the diagnosis of primary pulmonary tuberculosis. Orthopedic surgery was performed as scheduled, given the patient's desire to proceed and careful coordination with infectious disease specialists. The surgery was technically successful and well-tolerated.

Post-operatively, the patient began standard pain management, deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, and physical therapy. Care was complicated by the concurrent diagnosis of active pulmonary tuberculosis. He was placed on appropriate respiratory isolation precautions. A multi-drug regimen for TB was initiated in consultation with infectious disease. The patient tolerated the initiation of TB medications well, with no significant side effects noted during the hospitalization. Monitoring of liver function and other relevant labs was performed.

Physical therapy was initiated post-operatively, focusing on left knee range of motion, strengthening, and gait training with weight-bearing as tolerated on the left leg. Due to the pre-existing right arm sequela, therapy required adaptation, with increased focus on core strength and utilizing assistive devices tailored to his upper extremity limitations. The surgical wound remained clean and dry. Pain control was achieved with oral medications. DVT prophylaxis with subcutaneous medication was continued. The patient's respiratory status remained stable on room air, and cough frequency/severity showed initial improvement with the onset of TB therapy. He was deemed medically stable from both the orthopedic and infectious disease standpoint for discharge to a setting where both complex medical management (TB treatment adherence, monitoring) and post-surgical rehabilitation could be continued.

**Medications on Admission:**
(List of home medications provided separately on admission record was reviewed and is incorporated into the discharge list as appropriate.)

Date of Birth: ___ Sex: Male

Service: MEDICINE / ORTHOPEDICS CONSULT

Allergies: Penicillin (Rash)

Attending: Dr. ___

Chief Complaint: Severe left knee pain.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None

History of Present Illness:
Mr. ___ is a pleasant gentleman with a history of severe degenerative joint disease affecting primarily the left knee, admitted due to an acute exacerbation of chronic pain refractory to outpatient management with physical therapy, oral analgesics, and intra-articular injections. His baseline mobility has declined significantly over recent months, impacting his activities of daily living. He reports constant aching pain in the left knee, intensified with weight-bearing and ambulation. Pain was rated 8-9/10 upon admission. The patient also carries a history of sequelae from past war operations involving destruction of aircraft, which results in chronic musculoskeletal and neurologic challenges contributing to his overall functional status. He also recently sustained a left eye contusion prior to this admission, which is reportedly improving but adds to his discomfort.

Past Medical History:
1. Left knee osteoarthritis
2. Sequela of war operations involving destruction of aircraft
3. Left eye contusion (recent)
4. Hypertension
5. Hyperlipidemia

Social History:

Vital Signs: Stable, afebrile. BP elevated on admission but controlled with medication.
Eyes: Left eye with mild periorbital ecchymosis, globe intact, extraocular movements full, vision subjectively unchanged. Consulted Ophthalmology.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Gastrointestinal: Abdomen soft, non-tender, bowel sounds present.
Genitourinary: Voiding without difficulty.
Neurologic: Grossly intact, no focal deficits appreciated. Mental status baseline.
Musculoskeletal: Left knee swollen with moderate effusion, diffuse tenderness to palpation. Range of motion significantly limited and painful. Strength diminished due to pain. Right knee with mild degenerative changes but less symptomatic. Gait significantly impaired, requiring assistance and reporting instability. Spine exam limited but consistent with chronic changes related to war operations history.

Pertinent Results:
Significant laboratory findings on admission included mild hyponatremia (Na 133) which corrected with fluid management. Complete blood count, renal and liver function tests otherwise within normal limits or stable to baseline. Plain radiographs of the left knee demonstrate severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis with joint space narrowing, osteophytes, and subchondral cysts. No acute fracture or dislocation seen. Ophthalmology consultation noted resolving contusion, stable visual acuity, and recommended outpatient follow-up.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medicine service for medical management of severe left knee pain due to osteoarthritis, in the context of complex medical history including sequela from war operations and a recent left eye contusion. Initial management focused on aggressive pain control with scheduled and as-needed oral and intravenous analgesics, including opioids and acetaminophen. Physical therapy was initiated to work on pain-free range of motion, strengthening, and gait training. Occupational therapy assessed the need for adaptive equipment to aid with activities of daily living. Orthopedics was consulted for evaluation of the severe osteoarthritis; given the patient's overall medical complexity and functional baseline, the current focus remains on optimizing non-surgical management and quality of life. The recent left eye contusion was monitored, and Ophthalmology provided recommendations for outpatient follow-up. His hyponatremia resolved with intravenous fluids. The patient responded well to the pain management regimen, with reported pain levels decreasing to 4-5/10 at rest and tolerable levels with activity. His mobility improved with therapy interventions. The patient and care team discussed the plan for continued outpatient therapy and pain management strategies.

Family History:
Notable for neurological conditions in extended family. Specifics regarding Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome were not fully elucidated during this admission.

Physical Exam at Discharge:
General: Alert and oriented, resting comfortably in bed. Appears clinically stable.
Vital Signs: Within normal limits. Afebrile.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Capillary refill brisk.
Respiratory: Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally, no cough or shortness of breath.
Gastrointestinal: Abdomen soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present. Tolerating diet.
Genitourinary: Voiding spontaneously, no complaints.
Neurologic: Baseline cognitive status maintained. Gross motor function limited by surgical extremity and pre-existing neurological condition, but no acute deficits noted. Cranial nerves intact to gross assessment. Sensation intact.
Musculoskeletal: Right lower extremity with intact surgical dressing (Aquacel with secondary dressing). No significant swelling or calf tenderness. Distal pulses palpable, sensation intact. Able to perform basic range of motion exercises as instructed. Incision site clean and dry with staples intact. Left knee non-tender, range of motion preserved.

Pertinent Results:
Admission labs included a comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count. Initial testing upon admission revealed a detectable level of alcohol in the blood. This finding was noted, and the patient was monitored, with no acute issues arising during the stay related to this. Other admission labs showed mild pre-renal azotemia which improved with hydration, and mild normocytic anemia which remained stable. Post-operative labs were unremarkable, showing expected drops in hemoglobin/hematocrit which stabilized without transfusion. Chemistry panels remained stable.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for elective right total knee arthroplasty. Pre-operatively, the patient's medical history, including the known Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome and benign oral neoplasm, was reviewed. The finding of alcohol in blood upon admission was noted and did not require specific intervention during the hospital stay, given the patient's stable clinical status.
The patient underwent the planned right total knee arthroplasty on \_\_\_. The procedure was technically successful and well-tolerated.
Post-operatively, the patient's course was generally uncomplicated. Pain was managed effectively with a multimodal regimen including intravenous and oral analgesics, transitioning to primarily oral medications prior to discharge. Anticoagulation for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis was initiated on post-operative day 1 with subcutaneous enoxaparin. Physical therapy was initiated immediately post-operatively, focusing on range of motion, strengthening, and mobility training with the goal of weight-bearing as tolerated on the operative extremity. The patient participated daily in therapy sessions, making progress towards discharge goals, although the known neurological condition presented some inherent limitations in functional gains compared to a patient without such a diagnosis. The surgical wound was monitored daily; the Aquacel dressing remained in place until post-operative day 7, at which point it was changed to a dry sterile dressing as needed. Laboratory values were monitored, showing expected post-operative changes and stable electrolytes. Diet advanced as tolerated. At the time of discharge, the patient was comfortable, afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and deemed appropriate for transfer to an inpatient rehabilitation facility for continued intensive therapy.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Internal Medicine service for evaluation and management of severe left knee osteoarthritis pain in the context of her ongoing high-risk pregnancy due to potential fetal impact from a prior viral exposure. Orthopedic consultation was obtained to assess the severity of the knee pathology and discuss management options. Given the pregnancy, definitive surgical intervention such as total knee replacement was deferred until post-partum. Conservative pain management strategies were reviewed and adjusted to be safe during pregnancy. This included physical therapy evaluation for appropriate exercises and modalities, and optimization of oral pain medication regimen focusing on acetaminophen. Opioid use was minimized and managed carefully with obstetrics consultation due to pregnancy status. The patient's pain improved modestly with the adjusted regimen and rest. The obstetrics team was involved throughout the stay to monitor maternal and fetal well-being, particularly in relation to the previously identified viral exposure concerns, and ensure coordination of care. Diagnostic imaging (shielded X-rays) confirmed severe osteoarthritis. Labs were monitored and remained stable. At the time of discharge, the patient reported her pain was somewhat improved compared to admission, manageable on the adjusted oral regimen. She was ambulating safely with assistance for balance/support as needed, tolerating a regular diet, and vital signs were stable.

Complete Blood Count: Hemoglobin and Hematocrit stable post-operatively. White blood cell count normalized following initial elevation related to venom exposure.
Coagulation Profile: Within normal limits.
Creatine Kinase: Elevated initially following venom exposure, trending down during hospitalization.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted on \_\_\_ for scheduled left total knee arthroplasty. Pre-operative assessment and labs were completed. The patient was taken to the operating room on the day of admission where a left total knee arthroplasty was successfully performed without immediate complication. The patient tolerated the anesthetic and procedure well. Post-operatively, the patient was transferred to the orthopedic floor for recovery.

The post-operative course was largely focused on pain management, mobility, and physical therapy initiation. Pain was managed effectively with a multimodal regimen including scheduled acetaminophen, as-needed oral opioids, and regional nerve block where applicable. DVT prophylaxis was initiated per protocol. Physical therapy commenced on post-operative day 1, focusing on range of motion, strengthening, and ambulation with assistance. The patient made steady progress towards discharge goals.

An intercurrent event occurred on post-operative day 2 when the patient reported symptoms consistent with a rattlesnake bite sustained prior to admission but whose effects became more apparent during the hospital stay. Initial assessment revealed localized swelling and pain at the bite site on the right upper extremity, remote from the surgical site. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated creatine kinase and a transient elevation in white blood cell count. Toxicology consultation was obtained, and supportive care was initiated. The patient was monitored closely for signs of envenomation progression, but fortunately, the effects remained localized and mild, not requiring antivenom therapy. Symptoms related to the bite site gradually improved with rest, elevation, and monitoring. This event did not significantly impede the patient's orthopedic recovery timeline, though it necessitated additional monitoring and management resources during the stay.

By the time of discharge, the patient's surgical pain was well-controlled on oral medications. The surgical wound remained clean and dry. The patient was mobile with an assistive device, able to transfer and ambulate distances sufficient for home needs. Symptoms from the rattlesnake bite had largely resolved, requiring no specific ongoing treatment at discharge beyond general wound care if applicable (though no significant wound noted on exam). The patient was deemed medically stable and ready for discharge to home.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted to the general surgery service under the care of Dr. ___ for management of a second-degree abdominal wall burn. Initial management focused on pain control, wound cleaning, and application of appropriate burn dressings. The burn was assessed as second-degree, covering approximately ___% TBSA. Daily wound care including gentle debridement of non-viable tissue and application of topical antimicrobial agents (e.g., silver sulfadiazine) and appropriate dressings was performed. The patient's pain was managed with intravenous and later oral opioid and non-opioid analgesics, titrated to effect.

Concurrent management addressed the patient's chronic conditions. His significant low back pain related to the L5 nonunion and instability required careful attention to positioning and activity limitations. Physical therapy was consulted to provide recommendations for safe mobility, considering the burn wound, back pain, and knee osteoarthritis. The patient was advised regarding activity modification to minimize stress on the lumbar spine. Pain related to the knee osteoarthritis was managed adjunctively with acetaminophen and as-needed use of breakthrough pain medication prescribed for the burn/back pain.

Throughout the hospital stay, the burn wound showed expected signs of healing for a second-degree injury, with reduction in erythema and blistering and progression towards re-epithelialization in some areas. There were no signs of wound infection. The patient's pain became manageable on oral medications. Vital signs remained stable, and laboratory parameters trended appropriately. The patient tolerated a regular diet and demonstrated ability to manage personal care with assistance, adhering to activity restrictions. Decision was made to discharge the patient home for continued wound care and pain management.

Open Reduction and Internal Fixation (ORIF) of right first metacarpal base fracture

History of Present Illness:
The patient, Mr. ___, a gentleman with known severe right knee osteoarthritis, presented to the emergency department after sustaining a fall at his residence. Immediately following the fall, he reported sharp pain in his right hand and discomfort in his abdomen, which rapidly progressed to severe, diffuse abdominal pain. Within hours of arrival, he developed shortness of breath and altered mental status. Initial assessment revealed signs of peritonitis on physical exam and imaging, consistent with a perforated viscus. A right first metacarpal base fracture was also identified on hand X-ray. Further investigation prompted concern for fat embolism syndrome given the combination of trauma, respiratory findings, and neurological changes, which was managed supportively. The patient was urgently taken to the operating room for surgical repair of the duodenal perforation and subsequently underwent orthopedic intervention for his hand fracture once medically stable. His hospital course was complex, requiring multidisciplinary care.

Laboratory: White blood cell count trending down. Hemoglobin and hematocrit stable. Electrolytes within normal limits. Liver and renal function tests unremarkable.

Brief Hospital Course:
Upon admission for the fall and resulting injuries, the patient was found to have a perforated duodenal ulcer and a displaced right first metacarpal base fracture. He was urgently taken to the operating room for repair of the duodenal perforation via Graham patch under the General Surgery service. Postoperatively, his abdominal pain improved. Shortly after surgery, the patient developed respiratory and neurological symptoms consistent with traumatic fat embolism syndrome. He received supportive care, including respiratory support as needed, and close monitoring. His fat embolism symptoms gradually resolved over several days.

Once medically stable following the abdominal surgery and resolution of fat embolism symptoms, the patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of his right first metacarpal base fracture under the Orthopedic service. The procedure was tolerated well.

His recovery involved careful pain management, monitoring of surgical sites, and supportive care for residual effects of the embolism. Physical and occupational therapy consultations were initiated to assist with mobility challenges related to his knee OA and the hand fracture recovery. Nutritional support was provided as he transitioned from NPO status to a regular diet. Antibiotics were administered initially for the perforated ulcer and discontinued per protocol. DVT prophylaxis was maintained throughout the stay.

At the time of discharge, the patient was clinically stable, ambulating short distances with assistance, tolerating oral intake, and pain was controlled with oral medication. The hand fracture was stabilized in a cast, and abdominal surgical sites were healing appropriately. Symptoms related to the fat embolism had largely resolved.

**Patient Information:**
Name: Mr. ___
Unit No: ___
Date of Birth: ___
Sex: M
Admission Date: ___
Discharge Date: ___

**Service:** Internal Medicine (or relevant service managing acute medical issues)
**Attending Physician:** Dr. ___

**Allergies:** Penicillin

**Reason for Admission:**
Acute onset altered mental status and unresponsiveness secondary to presumed poisoning by neuroleptic agents.

**Major Surgical or Invasive Procedures:**
No major surgical procedures performed during this admission. Procedures limited to central venous catheter placement for monitoring and medication administration, and temporary endotracheal intubation for airway protection due to depressed level of consciousness.

**History of Present Illness:**
The patient, a gentleman with a known history of osteoarthritis affecting an unspecified knee and a documented dentofacial functional abnormality, presented to the Emergency Department after being found unresponsive by family. Information gathered suggested potential poisoning via intentional administration of unknown substances containing neuroleptic agents, indicated as an assault. Upon arrival, the patient exhibited severely depressed consciousness and required airway support. Initial management focused on stabilizing vital signs and identifying the causative agent. He was transferred to the intensive care unit for continuous monitoring and supportive care. Over the subsequent days, his neurological status gradually improved, allowing for successful extubation and transfer to a general medical floor for continued recovery and observation. Throughout his stay, attention was also given to managing his pre-existing osteoarthritis, which limited his mobility during recovery. His dentofacial functional abnormality was noted but did not require acute intervention during this hospitalization.

**Past Medical History:**
- Unilateral primary osteoarthritis (unspecified knee)
- Dentofacial functional abnormality (unspecified)
- Hypertension
- Mild obstructive sleep apnea

**Social History:**
Lives at home with family. Details regarding employment, smoking status, and alcohol use were obtained and are on file.

**Family History:**
Reported non-contributory for significant medical conditions.

**Physical Examination on Discharge:**
General: Alert and oriented x 3, comfortably resting in bed, appearing stable.
Vital Signs: Temperature afebrile, heart rate regular, blood pressure within acceptable limits for discharge, respiratory rate normal, oxygen saturation >95% on room air.
Head/Neck: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Mucous membranes moist. Dentofacial assessment deferred to outpatient.
Cardiovascular: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Distal pulses 2+ bilaterally.
Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Normal respiratory effort.
Gastrointestinal: Abdomen soft, non-tender, non-distended. Bowel sounds present. Tolerating oral diet.
Genitourinary: Voiding without difficulty.
Neurologic: Cranial nerves intact. Motor strength 5/5 in upper extremities, 4/5 in lower extremities (limited by osteoarthritis). Sensation intact. Gait unsteady without assistance due to knee pain and deconditioning from hospitalization.
Skin: Warm and dry. Incision sites (if any from procedures) clean and dry. No rashes or lesions.
Musculoskeletal: Mild swelling and tenderness noted in the affected knee. Range of motion limited by pain.

**Pertinent Results:**
- Initial Toxicology Screen: Positive for neuroleptics (e.g., specific butyrophenone/thiothixene substances identified or suspected). Negative for other common illicit substances.
- Serial Basic Metabolic Panels: Resolved initial electrolyte derangements. Renal and hepatic function remained within normal limits throughout the stay.
- Complete Blood Count: White blood cell count normalized post-admission. Hemoglobin and hematocrit stable.
- Serial EKGs: Showed transient changes attributed to the acute poisoning, resolved prior to discharge.
- Chest X-ray: Cleared post-intubation, no evidence of aspiration or pneumonia.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
Patient was admitted following acute poisoning presumed due to assault. Initial management involved airway protection via intubation, placement of a central line, and aggressive supportive care in the intensive care setting. Continuous monitoring of cardiac and neurological status was performed. Toxicology confirmed the presence of neuroleptic agents. As the effects of the poisoning began to wane, the patient's level of consciousness improved. He was successfully extubated and monitored closely for respiratory function and signs of withdrawal or residual neuroleptic effects. Pain associated with his pre-existing knee osteoarthritis was managed with scheduled and as-needed oral analgesics. Physical therapy was initiated to address deconditioning and mobility limitations exacerbated by both the acute illness and his chronic knee pain. Dietary services ensured adequate nutritional intake as he regained ability to eat orally. Psychiatric consultation was obtained to address the assault aspect and the patient's mental state post-recovery. Social work facilitated discharge planning, including identifying appropriate support services. The patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable for 48 hours prior to discharge. He demonstrated ability to ambulate short distances with assistance. All lines were removed. He was deemed medically stable for discharge home with ongoing support.

This is Ms. ___, a pleasant woman presenting with severe, chronic, degenerative joint disease affecting the left knee. She has experienced worsening pain and stiffness over several years, significantly impacting her mobility and quality of life, despite trials of conservative measures including physical therapy, injections, and oral analgesics. The left knee pain has become refractory to non-operative management. Her baseline mobility is already somewhat limited due to a prior non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage which resulted in a mild residual left-sided paralytic syndrome. This pre-existing weakness further complicated her ability to compensate for the severe knee pain and limited range of motion. After thorough discussion of risks and benefits, she elected to proceed with left total knee arthroplasty.

**Past Medical History:**
*   Primary Osteoarthritis, left knee
*   History of Non-traumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage with residual left non-dominant side paralytic syndrome.
*   Adverse effect from unspecified hormone antagonist (details unavailable in system).

**Brief Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted electively for left total knee arthroplasty. Pre-operative evaluation included standard assessments, and she was cleared for surgery. She underwent left total knee arthroplasty on ___. The procedure was completed without apparent complication. She was transferred to the PACU in stable condition and subsequently admitted to the orthopedic floor.

Postoperatively, pain management was initiated using a multimodal approach including intravenous and oral analgesics. She was started on chemical thromboprophylaxis with Aspirin 325 mg orally twice daily from the morning of post-operative day 1.

Physical therapy was initiated on post-operative day 1. Therapy focused on range of motion exercises for the left knee, strengthening exercises (modified due to baseline left-sided weakness), and gait training. Progress was steady, but gait training required close attention to compensate for the pre-existing neurological deficit. She advanced from walker to cane with assistance.

Wound care consisted of daily dressing changes. The incision remained clean and dry throughout the hospitalization, without signs of infection or dehiscence. Staple line was intact at discharge.

She tolerated diet progression well. Bowel function was managed with stool softeners and laxatives as needed. Foley catheter was removed on post-operative day 1, and she voided without difficulty thereafter.

At the time of discharge, the patient was ambulating safely with an assistive device (walker) with supervision, managing stairs with assistance, and had achieved functional range of motion suitable for home recovery. Pain was well-controlled on oral medications. The surgical wound was healing appropriately. Her baseline neurological status remained stable.

**Patient Name:** Mr. ___
**Unit Number:** ___

**Admission Date:** ___
**Discharge Date:** ___

**Date of Birth:** ___
**Sex:** Male

**Service:** Orthopedic Surgery

**Allergies:**
Penicillin (Rash)

**Attending Physician:** Dr. ___

**Chief Complaint:**
Severe chronic left knee pain exacerbated by activity.

**History of Present Illness:**
Mr. ___ is a gentleman with a long-standing history of symptomatic osteoarthritis in the left knee, which has significantly worsened over the past year, limiting his mobility and quality of life. He reports increasing pain, stiffness, and swelling despite trials of conservative management including physical therapy, activity modification, over-the-counter pain relievers, and multiple intra-articular corticosteroid injections, all providing only temporary relief. His knee symptoms are complicated by a remote history of a displaced fracture at the base of the neck of the left femur, sustained during military service approximately ___ years ago, which healed with significant malunion. This prior injury has contributed to altered biomechanics and accelerated degenerative changes in the ipsilateral knee. Given the failure of non-operative interventions and the severity of his symptoms impacting his activities of daily living, the decision was made for elective admission for management of his advanced left knee osteoarthritis. During pre-admission screening and subsequent inpatient workup triggered by a chronic cough, the patient was diagnosed with active tuberculosis.

**Past Medical History:**
1.  Severe osteoarthritis, left knee
2.  Remote left femur neck fracture with malunion (sustained during military service)
3.  Active Tuberculosis (initially diagnosed during this admission)
4.  Chronic cough
5.  Hypertension (well controlled on home medication)

**Social History:**
Resides at home with ___ support structure. History of military service. Reportedly quit smoking many years ago; denies current tobacco use. Occasional alcohol use.

**Family History:**
Non-contributory to present admission.

**Physical Examination at Discharge:**
General: Alert and oriented, appears comfortable, in no acute distress.
Vital Signs: Stable, afebrile. BP ___, HR ___, RR ___, SpO2 ___% on room air.
Lungs: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, no crackles or wheezes. Cough significantly improved since starting therapy.
Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.
Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, positive bowel sounds.
Musculoskeletal (Left Lower Extremity): Post-surgical dressing intact over the anterior knee incision. Surgical site with minimal serosanguinous drainage observed on dressing change. Mild residual swelling of the left knee and thigh. Patient able to bear weight as tolerated with assistive device. Range of motion improving with therapy. Distal pulses palpable, capillary refill brisk, sensation intact.
Neurological: Grossly intact, no focal deficits noted.

**Pertinent Results:**
-   Sputum Microscopy: Positive for Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFB) on serial samples.
-   Chest X-ray: Demonstrated findings consistent with old granulomatous disease; no active infiltrates or cavities identified on admission, but findings prompted TB workup.
-   Complete Blood Count: WBC ___, Hgb ___, Platelets ___ (Stable).
-   Electrolytes & Renal Function: Within normal limits.
-   Liver Function Tests: Monitored closely following initiation of anti-TB regimen; demonstrating mild transient transaminitis which is being followed.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
The patient was admitted electively for management of severe left knee osteoarthritis. Upon admission and subsequent evaluation including workup for chronic cough, active tuberculosis (TB) was diagnosed based on positive sputum microscopy. Due to the diagnosis of active, potentially infectious TB, the planned orthopedic procedure (originally total knee arthroplasty) was deferred. The immediate focus of the hospitalization shifted to the initiation and management of anti-tuberculosis therapy. The patient was placed on respiratory isolation precautions. A standard four-drug anti-TB regimen was promptly initiated. Patient tolerated the initial doses well with mild nausea but no significant adverse reactions. Public Health department was notified per protocol. Extensive counseling was provided to the patient regarding the nature of TB, the importance of treatment adherence, isolation precautions, and follow-up requirements. Throughout the stay, the patient's cough improved significantly and repeat sputum smears were trending towards negative. Pain from the left knee was managed with oral analgesics, physical therapy focused on maintaining range of motion and strength, and activity modification. Due to the deferred surgery, the hospitalization was primarily focused on stabilizing his TB condition and initiating definitive therapy before proceeding with any major elective orthopedic intervention in the future. At the time of discharge, the patient was clinically stable regarding both his underlying orthopedic issues and his newly initiated TB treatment, tolerating oral medications, and respiratory isolation precautions were discontinued based on clinical response and pending follow-up sputum results demonstrating non-infectiousness.

History of Present Illness:
This ___ year old male patient presented to the Emergency Department following a fall at home earlier today. He reported immediately experiencing severe pain and swelling in his right ankle and lower leg, rendering him unable to stand or walk. He denies head injury, loss of consciousness, or other trauma. He has a history of symptomatic right knee osteoarthritis, which has limited his mobility, and he notes the fall was likely related to unsteadiness due to his leg pain. He was transported via ambulance to the hospital. Imaging revealed a displaced transverse fracture of the shaft of the right fibula along with associated soft tissue injury. Given the nature of the fracture and absence of significant instability or open injury, non-surgical management was initiated with immobilization and pain control. He was admitted for pain management, assessment of neurovascular status, safe mobility planning, and education regarding his injury and recovery.

*   Right ankle/foot within boot: Palpable pulses (dorsalis pedis, posterior tibial) are strong. Capillary refill brisk. Gross sensation intact distally. Mild swelling noted around ankle visible above boot line. No open wounds or skin breakdown observed.

Pertinent Results:
Right Ankle X-ray: Displaced transverse fracture of the right fibula shaft. No other fractures noted. Mild soft tissue swelling.
Complete Blood Count: Within normal limits.
Basic Metabolic Panel: Within normal limits.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Orthopedic service following presentation with a right fibula fracture and associated soft tissue injuries sustained in a fall. Initial assessment confirmed the displaced transverse fracture of the fibula shaft. Due to the characteristics of the fracture, a decision was made for non-surgical management with immobilization. A walking boot was applied.

Pain management was initiated utilizing scheduled oral analgesics and PRN medications, achieving adequate pain control throughout the hospitalization. The patient's neurovascular status of the right lower extremity was closely monitored and remained stable, with intact pulses, sensation, and capillary refill distally.

Due to the lower extremity injury necessitating limited weight-bearing on the right ankle and the patient's pre-existing severe right knee osteoarthritis, mobilization presented a significant challenge. Physical Therapy evaluated the patient and provided training on safe transfers and ambulation using an assistive device (walker) with strict non-weight-bearing on the right lower extremity. The patient demonstrated ability to safely transfer to/from bed/chair and ambulate short distances with assistance.

Chemoprophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis was initiated given the lower extremity immobilization. The patient tolerated oral intake well and remained afebrile. His baseline medical conditions were managed and remained stable.

At the time of discharge, the patient reported manageable pain on oral medications, demonstrated safe non-weight-bearing transfers and mobility with a walker, and expressed understanding of discharge instructions. His clinical status allowed for safe discharge to home with necessary support.

Left Upper Extremity: Obvious deformity and swelling of the distal forearm and wrist. Open wound noted over the dorsal aspect with visible bone fragments. Sensation intact distally, pulses palpable. Pain with any attempted movement.
Right Lower Extremity: Tenderness and limited range of motion in the right knee, consistent with known osteoarthritis. No acute findings related to the knee upon admission.
Neurological: Alert and oriented. No focal deficits noted apart from the injured limb.

Pertinent Results:
Initial X-rays: Displaced comminuted fracture of the left distal radius with dorsal displacement and associated soft tissue injury, consistent with an open Smith's fracture. Right knee films showed severe degenerative changes.
Laboratory Data: Initial CBC showed mild leukocytosis, likely stress/injury-related. Hemoglobin and hematocrit within normal limits initially, trended down slightly post-operatively but remained stable. Glucose levels elevated on admission but controlled with adjusted medication regimen. Chemistry panel unremarkable. Wound cultures obtained during surgery were negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted directly to the orthopedic surgery service due to the open nature of the left distal radius fracture. She was started on broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics immediately upon arrival in the Emergency Department. After initial stabilization and assessment, she was taken to the operating room on the day of admission for irrigation and debridement of the open wound and open reduction internal fixation of the distal radius fracture using a volar plate and screws. A sterile dressing and splint were applied post-operatively.

Postoperative management included continued IV antibiotics for 48 hours followed by transition to oral antibiotics based on clinical improvement and negative cultures. Pain was managed effectively with a combination of intravenous and subsequently oral analgesics. The surgical wound was checked daily and remained clean with minimal drainage. The patient required assistance with mobility and activities of daily living due to limitations from both her left wrist immobilization and pre-existing right knee pain. Physical and Occupational Therapy evaluated the patient and initiated gentle range of motion exercises for the elbow and shoulder and provided instruction on functional tasks adapted for her injuries. DVT prophylaxis was administered daily. Blood glucose was monitored closely and managed.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
Mr. ___ was admitted for evaluation and management of acutely worsening right knee pain due to severe osteoarthritis. Upon admission, his pain was assessed, and a multidisciplinary approach was initiated. He received scheduled and as-needed oral analgesics, including acetaminophen and opioid medication, which provided some relief. Physical therapy was consulted and began daily sessions focusing on gentle range of motion, strengthening exercises, and gait training with a walker to improve mobility and functional status. Orthopedics was consulted, confirming the severity of the OA and discussing future options, including potential total knee arthroplasty, which the patient will consider as an outpatient.

Concurrently, the superficial frostbite on the right index finger was identified and managed conservatively with gentle warming and monitoring. No significant blistering or tissue damage occurred, and the area remained clean and pain-free.

Pain control for the knee improved significantly with the optimized regimen. The patient's mobility increased with physical therapy, allowing him to ambulate safely with assistance. His vital signs remained stable throughout the stay, and he tolerated a regular diet. The frostbite area showed signs of healing by the time of discharge.

**Brief Hospital Course:**
Mr. ___ was admitted to the orthopedic service for elective right total knee arthroplasty. Following pre-operative assessment, including consultation regarding peri-operative anticoagulation management, he underwent the procedure on ___. The surgery was completed without significant complications. Please refer to the separate operative report for full details.

Post-operatively, the patient was managed on the surgical ward. Pain control was achieved using a multimodal approach including intravenous and oral analgesics. Physical therapy initiated ambulation on post-operative day one, progressing with walker assistance. DVT prophylaxis with Aspirin 325 mg BID was commenced on post-operative day 1, in consultation with Cardiology/Hematology regarding his chronic anticoagulation. The management of his home anticoagulant was carefully orchestrated; it was held prior to surgery and a bridging strategy with low molecular weight heparin was employed until it was safe to resume his oral anticoagulant medication, which was restarted on post-operative day ___. This period required close monitoring of his coagulation status, which is reflected in his secondary diagnosis. He tolerated the return to his regular medication regimen well.

His wound dressing was managed per protocol. He remained afebrile with stable vital signs. He tolerated a regular diet. By the time of discharge, his pain was well controlled on oral medication, he was ambulating independently with an assistive device, and his coagulation status was stable on his planned discharge medication regimen.
